# Logic-based ordinary differential equation (Logic-ODE) model of cellular stress response pathway to predict liver toxicity

## Abstract
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most prevalent adversity encountered in drug development and clinical settings leading to urgent needs to understand the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamics of the activation of cellular stress response pathways and cell death outcomes upon exposure of a panel of liver toxicants using live cell imaging of fluorescent reporter cell lines. We established a comprehensive temporal dynamic response profile of a large set of BAC-GFP HepG2 cell lines representing the following components of stress signaling: i) unfolded protein response (UPR) [ATF4, XBP1, BIP and CHOP]; ii) oxidative stress [NRF2, SRXN1, HMOX1]; iii) DNA damage [P53, P21, BTG2, MDM2]; and iv) NF-ÎºB pathway [A20, ICAM1]. We quantified the single cell GFP expression as a surrogate for endogenous protein expression using live cell imaging over > 60 h upon exposure to 14 DILI compounds at multiple concentrations. Using logic-based ordinary differential equation (Logic-ODE), we modelled the dynamic profiles of the different stress responses and extracted specific descriptors potentially predicting the progressive outcomes. We identified the activation of ATF4-CHOP axis of the UPR as the key pathway showing the highest correlation with cell death upon DILI compound perturbation. Knocking down main components of the UPR provided partial protection from compound-induced cytotoxicity, indicating a complex interplay among UPR components as well as other stress pathways. Our results suggest that a systematic analysis of the temporal dynamics of ATF4-CHOP axis activation can support the identification of DILI risk for new candidate drugs.
